#### Running program

Written as a Python package, so run with `python -m DNABot` from parent
directory.

To run from somewhere else, `export PYTHONPATH="/full/path/to/ASD0231324_247950`
first.

`-info`     Log level
`-debug`    Log level

`-fg`       Send output (log) to stdout, not to a file

There are command line arguments. Or will be. And a `dnabot.ini` config file
in the directory you run from (not the program itself). Real Soon Now.
